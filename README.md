- B3: https://paullipaulli.shinyapps.io/bcl-data/
- B4: https://paullipaulli.shinyapps.io/bcl-updated/

## **Assignment Option**:

- B3: Option A (BC Liquor)
- B4: Option C (Shiny App Updated)

## **B3 App Description (New Features)**:

1. Added a BC Liquor Store photo in the main panel for aesthetics
2. Allow users to search for multiple alcohol types at once instead of wine/beer/etc, one at a time
3. Created two separate tabs to place the histogram and data table
4. Output to show a interactive plot where the users can find x and y pixels on the histogram while hovering the cursor
5. Turned the static BC Liquor Data Table into an interactive table
6. Show the total number of results found in the data table whenever the filters change for users
7. Allow the user to download the filtered data table as a .csv file

## **B4 App Description (New Features Including Updated Features Highlighted)**:

1. Added a BC Liquor Store photo in the main panel for aesthetics
2. **Added a slider for users to custom the number of bins in the alcohol content histogram (also changes the bin width)**
3. Allow users to search for multiple alcohol types at once instead of wine/beer/etc, one at a time
4. Created **three** separate tabs to place the histogram, **scatterplot**, and data table
5. **Output to show a interactive histogram where hovering & clicking the cursor help locate bin range and find the frequency of each bin and display an 'error' default message when the cursor is outside the bin**
6. **Output to show an interactive scatterplot of the relationship between alcohol content and price (including an embedded feature where different colors corresponding to different alcohol types) where hovering the cursor tells users which x, y coordinates their cursor is currently on and display an 'error' default message when the cursor is outside the scatterplot**
7. Turned the static BC Liquor Data Table into an interactive table
8. Show the total number of results found in the data table whenever the filters change for users
9. Allow the user to download the filtered data table as a .csv file
